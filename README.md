Introduction

The quality and ease of transportation by road significantly depend on the condition of the road. The main factors that contribute and segregating a bad road from a good road are the traffic lane markers on the road and potholes. Potholes, are depressions on the road that a caused by the wearing out of the road. The potholes can cause serious damage to the vehicle, can also lead to fatal accidents, and significantly deteriorate the quality of the road. It becomes more important to have full alertness while riding a vehicle in such a condition. The UK government is has an initiative, to report potholes because of this reason. In this project, our attempt is to design a solution for a car with the help of computer vision and deep learning that can detect the potholes. This will give an edge to the driver and help in their decision-making while driving. There are various other use cases that will be benefitted from such a solution. The same solution can be used to determine the quality of roads more accurately and easily. This solution will also provide an important matrix that will be helpful to predict road safety as well as the location of the potholes. This solution also has the potential to be part of self-driving cars as the solution will work on real-time data.
